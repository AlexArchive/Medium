            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <img src="http://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2004/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a85dd8cd970b-pi.png" alt="" align="right">
            <p> I'm <a>Jeff Atwood</a>. I live in Berkeley, CA with my wife, two cats, one <a>three</a> children, and a whole lot of computers. I was weaned as a software developer on <a>various implementations of Microsoft BASIC in the 80's</a>, starting with my first microcomputer, the Texas Instruments <a>TI-99/4a</a>. I continued on the PC with Visual Basic 3.0 and Windows 3.1 in the early 90's, although I also spent significant time writing Pascal code in the first versions of Delphi. I am now quite comfortable in VB.NET or C#, despite the <a>evils of case sensitivity</a>. I'm currently learning Ruby.</p>

            <p>
                I consider myself a reasonably experienced Windowsweb software developer with a particular interest in the human side of software development, as represented in my <a>recommended developer reading list</a>. Computers are fascinating machines, but they're mostly a reflection of the people using them. In the art of software development, studying code isn't enough; you have to study the people behind the software, too.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In 2004 I began this blog. I don't mean to be overly dramatic, but <a>it changed my life</a>. Everything that comes after was made possible by this blog.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In 2005, I found my dream job at <a>Vertigo Software</a> and moved to California. You can take <a>a virtual tour of my old office</a> if you'd like.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In 2008 I decided to <a>choose my own adventure</a>. I founded and built <a>stackoverflow.com</a>, and what would ultimately become <a>the Stack Exchange network of Q&amp;A sites</a>, in a </a>joint venture with Joel Spolsky</a>. The Stack Exchange network is now one of the <a>top 150 largest sites on the Internet</a>. </p>
                </li>

                 <li>
                    <p>In early 2012 I decided to <a>leave Stack Exchange and spend time with my growing family</a> while I think about what the next thing could be. As of 2013, that turned out to be <a>Civilized Discourse Construction Kit, Inc</a>. and the <a>Discourse open-source discussion platform</a>. Here's to the next 5 years of improving conversations on the Internet!</a>. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This blog runs the excellent open source <a>Ghost</a> blogging software, and is now graciously hosted on their <a>blog hosting service.</a></p>

            <h1>Why do you blog?</h1>
            <p>Mostly for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of software development over time – whatever I am thinking about or working on. I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. I firmly believe that blogs are a two way conversation, so I welcome email and comments – as long as they're on topic, more or less.</p>

            <p>If you're into audio, there's a bit more in my 45 minute <a>.NET Rocks interview.</a> If you prefer interviews, I've done a few: one with ScribeSonic, one with Daily Blog Tips, and one with Caffeinated coder.</p>

            <h1>What the heck is that thing on the right?</h1>
            <p>It's a Wumpus. I sometimes go by the nickname or "handle" Wumpus online. The image is from one of my first computing experiences. I consider the Wumpus my power animal, but I don't look much like a Wumpus in person:</p>
