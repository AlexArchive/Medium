Concerns
	Clearly there is some discrepancy with the entry "models".
	Disqus comments system needs refactoring and improving (according to JustBlog.)
	Completely violating DRY in many cases (especially updating and adding posts.)

Bugs
	View count doesn't work.
	Updating a blog entry does not update the summary lol
	Non-published posts are displayed regardless.
