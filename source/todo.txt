Clearly there is some discrepancy with the blog entry model and entity. There shouldn't be annotations relating to the
view on the Entry entity.

Consideration for Not Published / Draft

Bundle client-side dependencies.

Make about-me a default page you cannot remove.

Search

If the admin is logged in, show edit and delete links on the blog entry.

Make Disqus more robust according to that Indian guy.

Error messages are needed.

Instead of storing the Summary, calculate it when it is read?
updating blog entry does not update the summary lol

need a nice font.

view count is broke.


Make AutoMapper use the slug converter.
